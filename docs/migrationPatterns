# Migration Patterns

- **Data Migration Strategy**: Prior to removing models, ensure a data migration strategy is in place to handle existing data and prevent loss.
- **Versioning and Management Practices**: Maintain proper versioning practices during schema updates to ensure clear tracking of changes and their implications.
- **Documentation of Migration Workflows**: Document migration workflows thoroughly to maintain consistency across development environments and align developer practices.
