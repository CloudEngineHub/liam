# Safe and Consistent Migration Strategies

## Sequencing Rules
- Always create new tables before modifying existing tables to avoid issues with referential integrity.

## Rollout Patterns
- Migrations should include comprehensive detail, including sequences and privilege adjustments, to maintain security and integrity.

## Reversibility Requirements
- Ensure each migration can be reversed, especially those that alter foreign key constraints or permissions.
- Document permission changes to clarify why they were made and ensure they meet application access requirements.
