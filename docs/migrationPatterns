# Safe and Consistent Migration Strategies

- Ensure that migrations reflect changes in the schema accurately, particularly when adding new fields to models.
- Test all CRUD operations after schema modifications to confirm that new fields are handled correctly across the application.
- Document schema changes thoroughly, including their purpose and usage, to facilitate team understanding and integration.
