# Project-Specific Constraints that Shape Schema Design

## Technical Assumptions
- The application requires all tables to follow a standard structure for consistency.
- Nullable foreign keys are acceptable based on business logic, as seen with `OverallReview` allowing a nullable `projectId`.

## ORM Limitations
- Ensure that any changes made in the database schema are reflected in the Prisma schema to maintain synchronization.

## Domain Modeling Needs
- Models should be designed to allow flexibility for future expansions, including potential relationships with other entities (e.g., possible foreign keys in `TestTable`).
