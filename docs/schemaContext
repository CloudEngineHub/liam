# Project-Specific Constraints that Shape Schema Design

- All new fields added to models must be assessed for their necessity in terms of application logic and data integrity.
- The inclusion of nullable fields should be carefully considered, and defaults should be applied when appropriate to ensure that application behavior remains predictable.
- Communication about schema changes is critical across teams, especially for those working on front-end and API integrations.
