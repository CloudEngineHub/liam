### Schema Patterns
- **Field Naming Conventions**: Use descriptive names for fields that clarify their purpose. For example, 'sample' in the `PRCommit` model clearly indicates the content it holds.
- **Data Type Selection**: Consider the size and nature of the data when choosing types. For textual data that may exceed a typical length, prefer `Text` over `String` in PostgreSQL.
- **Optional Fields**: If a field is optional, document its nullable nature clearly, as the absence of the `@required` directive implies it can be null.

### Canonical Design Choices
- New fields should be added with a clear intention and documented purpose to ensure understanding among developers.
