# Schema Patterns

- **Model Removal**: When removing models (e.g., `Doc` and `DocVersion`), ensure thorough documentation of the rationale and implications for future development.
- **Integration with External Systems**: Prefer integration with services like GitHub for document management to enhance performance and reduce schema complexity.
- **Clear Documentation**: Maintain clear records of features tied to removed models to guide future development and prevent loss of important functionalities.
- **Foreign Key Management**: Always drop foreign key constraints and associated indexes when removing models to avoid referential integrity issues.
