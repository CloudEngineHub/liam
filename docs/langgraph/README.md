# LangGraph.js Complete Guide

This directory contains a comprehensive guide for LangGraph.js - a low-level orchestration framework for building controllable agents.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Guidelines

### Avoid createReactAgent
**Do not use `createReactAgent` from `@langchain/langgraph/prebuilt` in production applications.** This function abstracts away prompt engineering and violates [Factor 2: Own Your Prompts](https://github.com/humanlayer/12-factor-agents/blob/main/content/factor-02-own-your-prompts.md) from the 12-factor-agents methodology.

**Why this matters:**
- `createReactAgent` is a "black box" that hides the prompt engineering from you
- You lose control over how your agent behaves and makes decisions
- Following the 12-factor principle, you should own and control your prompts directly
- Use LangGraph's low-level APIs instead to build agents with full transparency

**Instead of createReactAgent:** Build your agents using LangGraph's core primitives (nodes, edges, state management) as shown in the documentation below.
