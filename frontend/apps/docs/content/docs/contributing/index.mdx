## Changeset Requirements

When contributing to this repository, you may see comments from the changeset-bot about version bumps. Here's what you need to know:

### Documentation Changes
Changes to the `@liam-hq/docs` package do not require changesets. If you're only modifying files in the `frontend/apps/docs` directory, you can safely ignore the changeset-bot's comment. The bot will confirm that "Merging this PR will not cause a version bump for any packages", which is the expected behavior for documentation changes.

### Other Package Changes
For changes to other packages, you will need to add a changeset if your changes should result in a version bump. Follow the instructions in the changeset-bot's comment to add one.
