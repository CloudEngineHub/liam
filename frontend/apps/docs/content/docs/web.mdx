Liam ERD Web is an online tool hosted by [@liam-hq](https://github.com/liam-hq) that allows you to explore real-world ER diagrams without needing to install a CLI! ðŸ›¸ðŸ’«

It enables you to view ER diagrams generated from publicly available schema files, such as `db/schema.rb`, `prisma.schema`, or SQL files derived from `pg_dump`.

## How to Explore ðŸ›¸ðŸ’«

Inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into your browser's address bar will generate an ER diagram for your schema file.

For example, if the schema file you want to explore is hosted at the following URL:

```
# A public repo's schema file
https://github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
```

You can generate an ER diagram by inserting `liambx.com/erd/p/` into the URL:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/github.com/docusealco/docuseal/blob/master/db/schema.rb
      ðŸ‘¾^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ðŸ‘¾
```

It's so easy! Isn't it? ðŸš€

## Appendix: Schema Format Options

### Auto-Detecting Schema Format

When Liam ERD fetches your schema file, it automatically attempts to determine the schema format. The detection process works as follows:

- **File Name Check**: Filenames such as `schema.rb` or `Schemafile` are assumed to be in **`schemarb`** format.
- **File Extension Check**: Files ending in **`.rb`** are treated as **`schemarb`**, while files ending in **`.sql`** are treated as **`postgresql`**.
- For more details, refer to the [`detectFormat.ts`](https://github.com/liam-hq/liam/blob/main/frontend/packages/db-structure/src/parser/supportedFormat/detectFormat.ts) file in our GitHub repository.

### Overriding the Detected Format

If the automatic detection does not match your desired format, you can specify it manually using query parameters. For example:

```
https://liambx.com/erd/p/public.example.net/path/to/file?format=schemarb
```
