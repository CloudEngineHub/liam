## Loading Schema Files Hosted Outside GitHub

Liam ERD Web supports loading schema files hosted on GitHub by default. When you specify a GitHub URL (e.g., `github.com/username/repo/blob/branch/path/to/schema.rb`), Liam ERD automatically converts it to a raw content URL (`raw.githubusercontent.com/username/repo/branch/path/to/schema.rb`).

However, when loading schema files hosted on platforms other than GitHub, please note the following:

### Important Notes for Files Hosted Outside GitHub

- Liam ERD Web does not perform URL conversion for non-GitHub sources
- You must provide a direct link to the raw content file, not an HTML page
- The URL should point to a page that returns only the schema file content without HTML markup

### Examples

✅ **Correct URL Format (Raw Content)**
```
https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/gistid/raw/commitsha/filename.yml
https://gitlab.com/username/repo/-/raw/main/db/schema.rb
https://bitbucket.org/username/repo/raw/main/prisma.schema
```

❌ **Incorrect URL Format (HTML Pages)**
```
https://gist.github.com/username/gistid
https://gitlab.com/username/repo/-/blob/main/db/schema.rb
https://bitbucket.org/username/repo/src/main/prisma.schema
```

### Common Hosting Platforms

Here's how to get raw content URLs for common hosting platforms:

#### GitHub Gist
For Gists, you need to convert from the HTML page URL to the raw content URL:
- HTML page: `https://gist.github.com/username/gistid`
- Raw content: `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/username/gistid/raw/commitsha/filename.yml`

To get the raw content URL for a Gist, click the "Raw" button on the Gist page and copy the URL.

#### GitLab
Change `/blob/` to `/raw/` in the URL:
- HTML page: `https://gitlab.com/username/repo/-/blob/main/schema.rb`
- Raw content: `https://gitlab.com/username/repo/-/raw/main/schema.rb`

#### Bitbucket
Change `/src/` to `/raw/` in the URL:
- HTML page: `https://bitbucket.org/username/repo/src/main/schema.rb`
- Raw content: `https://bitbucket.org/username/repo/raw/main/schema.rb`

#### Self-hosted Git Services
Most self-hosted Git services (Gitea, Gogs, etc.) follow similar patterns. Look for a "Raw" button when viewing a file and use that URL.
