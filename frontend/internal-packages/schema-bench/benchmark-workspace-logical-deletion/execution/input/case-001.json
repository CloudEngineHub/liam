  "input": "Data management requirements for user account withdrawal (deletion) on an e-commerce site. Design a schema that satisfies the following.\n\n[Requirements]\n1) Referential integrity: Even after withdrawal, historical business data such as past orders must remain consistent and queryable.\n2) Legal requirements: Personal data (name, email, address, phone number, date of birth, etc.) must be deletable or anonymizable according to retention periods and deletion/disclosure requests. Must support legal hold (deletion suspension).\n3) Business requirements: Store the withdrawal reason (reason code + optional free text) and the withdrawal timestamp, and make them available for analysis.\n4) Audit: Record an irreversible (tamper-evident) audit trail of withdrawal processing and personal data deletion/anonymization operations.\n5) Privacy: Business data (e.g., orders) must not directly depend on personal data, and after withdrawal, business references must be possible without identifying the individual.\n\n[Processes performed at withdrawal (scope)]\n- Record receipt of the withdrawal request (request time/requester/status).\n- Record finalization of withdrawal (confirmation time/operator/account status update/storage of withdrawal reason).\n- Delete or anonymize personal data (target fields: name/email/address/phone/date of birth, etc.).\n- If a legal hold exists, suspend deletion and record that fact and the processing performed upon release.\n- Record audit logs for each of the above operations.\n- Maintain the queryability of existing business data such as orders.\n"
