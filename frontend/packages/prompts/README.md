### Getting Started  

1. Set your `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable, or configure the necessary keys for your chosen providers.  

2. Edit `promptfooconfig.yaml` to customize your setup.  

3. Run the following command to start the evaluation:  
   ```sh
   promptfoo eval
   ```  

4. View the results with:  
   ```sh
   promptfoo view

This README and some YAML configurations were inspired by [this example](https://github.com/promptfoo/promptfoo/tree/0.106.0/examples/custom-grading-prompt).
