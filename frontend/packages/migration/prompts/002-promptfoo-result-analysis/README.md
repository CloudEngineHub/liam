# promptfoo-result-analysis

This repository contains the materials and scripts used to evaluate 34 migration review cases based on five key evaluation axes:

- Migration Safety
- Data Integrity
- Performance Impact
- Project Rules Consistency
- Security/Scalability

## Directory Structure

```
002-promptfoo-result-analysis
├── prompt-1.txt    # Overview of documents and evaluation tasks
├── Dockerfile      # Docker configuration to generate the boxplot in an isolated environment
├── boxplot.png     # Generated boxplot image of the evaluation scores
└── script.py       # Python script to create the boxplot using matplotlib
```

## Usage

1. **Build the Docker Image**  
   Navigate to the `002-promptfoo-result-analysis` directory and run:  
   ```bash
   docker build -t boxplot-generator .
   ```

2. **Run the Container**  
   Run the container while mounting your current directory to extract the PNG:
   ```bash
   docker run -v "$(pwd):/app" boxplot-generator
   ```

3. The generated boxplot image will be saved as `boxplot.png`.

## Documents Overview

- **prompt-1.txt**  
  Contains the description and context for two documents:
  - **Document A:** The prompt for generating review comments.
  - **Document Z:** Contains 34 consecutive examples of review results.
  
  These documents outline the review tasks, including mapping issues to the evaluation axes and suggesting improvements for the evaluation criteria.

## Notes

- The evaluation scores are visualized using a boxplot generated by a Python script (`script.py`).
- Docker is used to run the script in a clean, isolated environment without affecting the host system.
- Feel free to modify the script or the evaluation criteria based on your project requirements.
