    The purpose of this task is to create a minimal review report.  
    The RDBMS used is PostgreSQL.  

    (1) contains the differences between the Prisma schema file and the migration DDL. It also includes differences in the application code.  
    (2) is the schema.prisma file before the changes.  

    ### Instructions:
    #### **Instruction 1: Important**  
    Please review this migration, focusing **only** on the changes in the following files:  
    - `packages/shared/prisma/migrations/**`  
    - `packages/shared/prisma/schema.prisma`  

    At the beginning of your review, add the following disclaimer:  
    *"This review is based **only** on the provided diff files (`packages/shared/prisma/migrations/**` and `packages/shared/prisma/schema.prisma`)."*  

    #### **Instruction 2: Important**  
    While you may reference "application code" and "commit messages" as supporting information for assessing the migration, **do not** include them in the review comments.  

    #### **Instruction 3:**  
    If there are any uncertainties in making a judgment, please point them out as well.  

    #### **Instruction 4:**  
    Focus on evaluating whether the migration follows best practices, including:  
    - Whether the migration results in data loss  
    - Whether the changes are safe and allow for online DDL  
    - Efficient indexing  

    #### **Instruction 5:**  
    If there are issues related to **Instruction 4**, provide actionable suggestions for the reviewer wherever possible.  

    #### **Instruction 6: Important**  
    To reiterate, **do not** comment on the following:  
    - The need to modify "application code"  
    - The need to revise "commit messages"  
    - The need to update any other documentation  

    #### **Instruction 7:**  
    At the end of your review, add a disclaimer such as:  
    *"**Disclaimer:** This review is based solely on the provided information. A complete assessment would require a full understanding of the overall application."*  

    That concludes the main instructions. Below are the reference materials.
