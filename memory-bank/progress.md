# Progress

## What Works
- AI components have been successfully integrated to analyze migration impacts and provide intelligent suggestions.
- The product is deployed in the AWS us-east-1 region, supporting English-speaking markets.
- The GitHub App integration is operational, automating comments and review approvals on PRs.

## What's Left to Build
- Further refinement of AI components to enhance the accuracy and relevance of suggestions.
- Development of Builder User features, planned for later phases, leveraging accumulated review data and feedback.
- Exploration of multi-region deployment opportunities as user needs grow.

## Current Status
The project is currently focused on enhancing the Reviewer User experience, with AI-driven analysis and suggestions integrated into the migration review process. The initial release prioritizes the Reviewer User, with Builder User features planned for future phases.

## Known Issues
- Continuous learning for AI components is required to improve accuracy and relevance over time.
- The coexistence with the OSS version needs to be managed carefully to ensure a sustainable business model.
