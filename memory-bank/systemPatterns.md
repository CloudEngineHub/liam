# System Patterns

## System Architecture
Liam Migration is designed to integrate seamlessly with existing development workflows, particularly through its GitHub App integration. It leverages AI components to provide intelligent analysis and suggestions during the migration review process.

## Key Technical Decisions
- **AI-Driven Analysis**: The use of AI to automatically analyze migration impacts, predict risks, and suggest optimizations is central to the product's value proposition.
- **GitHub Integration**: The integration with GitHub repositories allows for automated comments and review approvals, streamlining the development process.
- **OSS and Paid Plan Coexistence**: The product is designed to coexist with its OSS version, offering high-value features in paid plans to ensure a sustainable business model.

## Design Patterns
- **Modular Architecture**: The system is built with a modular architecture to allow for easy integration and extension of features.
- **Continuous Learning**: The AI components are designed to continuously learn from past reviews to improve accuracy and relevance over time.

## Component Relationships
- **Review Agent**: Works closely with the GitHub App to provide real-time analysis and feedback on migration changes.
- **Migration Review Page**: Serves as the central interface for users to review detailed migration changes, AI suggestions, and improvement points.
- **Interactive Knowledge Base**: Links review comments with ER diagrams to enhance contextual understanding and formalize best practices.
