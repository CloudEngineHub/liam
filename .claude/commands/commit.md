Let's commit the changes.

**Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits
**Write a commit message that matches the content of your change**: Clearly describe what was changed in this commit. A good commit message should:
- Specify the component or feature affected (e.g., "authentication module").
- Describe the action taken (e.g., "fixed a bug," "added a new feature").
- Avoid vague messages like "fix bug" or "update code."

Examples of good commit messages:
- 🐛 Fixed a bug in the authentication module causing login failures
- ✨ Added a new feature to filter tables by column
- 📝 Updated README.md with new installation instructions

Examples of bad commit messages:
- "fix bug"
- "update code"
- "changes made"
- Use gitmoji (optional, recommended): Write commit messages using the emoji (e.g., ✨) itself, not the textual representation (e.g., `:sparkles:`)
