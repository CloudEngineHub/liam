Let's commit the changes.

**Split large changes**: If changes touch multiple concerns, split them into separate commits

- Use gitmoji (optional, recommended): Write commit messages using the emoji (e.g., ✨) itself, not the textual representation (e.g., `:sparkles:`)

## Examples

- ✨ Added a new feature to filter tables

- 📝 Updated README.md with new installation instructions

## Common Gitmoji Reference

- ✨ New feature
