- Display colorful "LIAM ERD" banner on CLI startup using Ink v6 and ink-gradient
- Show adaptive ASCII art that adjusts to terminal width (full vs. compact version)
- Banner automatically appears when running the `init` command
- Inspired by [oh-my-logo](https://github.com/shinshin86/oh-my-logo) project
